# Space Games Proposal

## What is Space Games?

The game is a themed and more fun version of rock, paper, scissors. In this case Comet, Nebula, Rocket. I love space themes and it is always a go to game when I can't come to an agreement with a friend.

## Initial thoughts on game structure

Challenges I expect to have is making the "computer" and the "players" choice appear simultaneously.  I expect if to use a timing function so that they may sync.

## Phases of Completion

Phase 0:

Theme- acqure assets - giphys 
Design- HTML/CSS - color scheme

Phase 1:

Pseudocode:
  -Create game logic

Phase 2:

-create divs
        ~player & computer options (3*3)
        ~player & computer display screen
    -add click events to divs
    
-create randomizer for computer.
-append images/giphs to main div on click
 
Phase 3:

-make the game 3:5
    -keep score for player & computer
    -declare winner / loser
    -reset game and start over
    -Stop game at 3:5.
    
Phase 4:

-Test / debug.
-Enhance / upgrade
